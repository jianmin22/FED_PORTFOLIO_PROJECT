                <p class="mb-0">I was desired to learn more about cybersecurity after few months of lessons in ITE, thus, me and my friends decided to give it a try when there is a chance for us to join this competition.
                  This competition was about CTF (Capture-The-Flag), through this competition, I learnt teamwork and resilience is important in order to success.
                  I also get to know more about how CTF works and get to know what exactly is cybersecurity. 
                  This competition benefits me a lot as I had learnt many different things that is not taught yet in school. Such as Cryptography, AI and web development.
